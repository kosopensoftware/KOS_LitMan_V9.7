About [KOS] Literature Manager:
-------------------------------
[KOS] Literature Manager is part of the [KOS] System Operations family of software. This program is designed to automate the storage of academic literature in such a way as to allow users to efficiently search and find the stored literature later. The program also allows users to assign notes to publications and these too can be searched for efficiently. Publication data is stored in an organized database and the program automatically creates LaTeX-ready reference lists when you store Bibtex information in the program. The program has a user interface and automates many processes, but further automation and customization are planned for the future.
The ultimate goal for this program is to handle literature management for extensive projects such as literature reviews or academic paper writing.

After downloading the [KOS]LitManV9.7_User_Installer from kosopensoftware.wordpress.com, simply click on the application. Next, you will need to tell the installer where to put the program files. You want the program to be placed somewhere you can easily access its folders to place publications in them. Once this is done the installer will place all the files in the correct place. Then enter the folder area and click on [KOS]LitManLauncher.exe or if this does not work, enter the ProgramFiles DIR and click on the [KOS]LitMan.exe application (This is the main application EXE). It is then advised to place a shortcut of this [KOS]LitMan.exe and a shortcut to the WaitingRoom DIR on the desktop if the program does not automatically do this for you. This should be everything and the program should run without issues.

Unless youâ€™re a developer looking to make alterations to the code, the user version is recommended as python is not essential. Alternatively, developers could just use the .exe application provided with the developer installation if they face issues with python.

To run the python version of the program, the developer will need to ensure that the following python packages are installed:
os | shutil | datetime | subprocess | time | docx | ctypes | sys | re | copy | msvcrt | win32com.client | pythoncom
The Launch.py script is capable of running the program, but the main.py script is the highest priority script for running the program. The setup.py script may also be useful for developers; this script will create a desktop and file area shortcut for the program.
